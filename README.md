Project Overview:

This Weather App provides real-time weather information using a weather API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app offers a user-friendly interface to check the current weather conditions for any city around the globe.

Features:

Real-time Weather Data: Fetches current weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Search Functionality: Users can search for weather updates by city name.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using modern CSS techniques.
Dynamic Updates: Utilizes JavaScript to dynamically update weather information without reloading the page.
Weather Icons: Displays appropriate weather icons based on current conditions.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the structure of the app.
CSS: Styles the app, ensuring a clean and responsive design.
JavaScript: Handles API requests, processes responses, and updates the DOM.
Weather API: Fetches real-time weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
How It Works:

User Input: The user enters a city name into the search bar.
API Request: JavaScript sends a request to the weather API with the specified city name.
Data Processing: The API returns weather data, which is then processed by JavaScript.
DOM Update: The app dynamically updates the displayed weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Responsive Design: The app layout adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
